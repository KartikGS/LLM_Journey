# Testing Contract Registry

This file tracks durable test contracts that should remain stable unless a CR explicitly changes them.

## How to Use
- Update this registry when routes, `data-testid` contracts, or accessibility semantics become stable product contracts.
- For CRs that intentionally change these contracts, include old->new mapping in plan/handoff/report artifacts.
- Use this as baseline context. Per-CR handoffs can narrow or extend scope.

## Route Contracts (Current)
