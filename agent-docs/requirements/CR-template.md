## Status
[Draft | Clarified | In Progress | Done | Done (user validation pending) | Blocked]

## Business Context
**User Need:**
**Expected Value:**
**Execution Mode:** [Standard | Fast | Heavy]

## Functional Requirements
1. 
2. 

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance:
- Security:
- Accessibility:

## System Constraints & Invariants
- **Constraint Mapping**: [List specific ADRs, technical-context, or tooling-standard rules that apply]
- **Design Intent**: [Is this change a core pivot or a standard feature extension? Why is it built this way?]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 
- [ ] 

## Verification Mapping
- **Development Proof**: [How should the developer prove the AC are met? e.g., 'Passes E2E test X', 'Manual verification of fallback UI']
- **AC Evidence Format (for closure)**:
  - Use one line per AC in this pattern:
  - ``[x] <AC text> — Verified: <file-or-command>, <result>``
  - Example:
  - ``[x] pnpm build passes — Verified: `pnpm build`, exit code 0``
- **User Validation**: [How will the human verify this? e.g., 'Navigation link takes me to /new-page']

## Baseline Failure Snapshot (Required for Regression/Incident CRs)
- **Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Command(s)**: [Exact command(s) used]
- **Execution Mode**: [sandboxed | local-equivalent/unsandboxed]
- **Observed Result**: [Failing specs/errors with concise facts]

## Post-Fix Validation Snapshot (Filled at Closure)
- **Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Command(s)**: [Exact command(s) used]
