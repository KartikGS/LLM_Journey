## System Constraints & Invariants
- **Constraint Mapping**: [List specific ADRs, technical-context, or tooling-standard rules that apply]
- **Design Intent**: [Is this change a core pivot or a standard feature extension? Why is it built this way?]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 
- [ ] 

## Verification Mapping
- **Development Proof**: [How should the developer prove the AC are met? e.g., 'Passes E2E test X', 'Manual verification of fallback UI']
- **AC Evidence Format (for closure)**:
  - Use one line per AC in this pattern:
  - ``[x] <AC text> — Verified: <file-or-command>, <result>``
  - Example:
  - ``[x] pnpm build passes — Verified: `pnpm build`, exit code 0``
- **User Validation**: [How will the human verify this? e.g., 'Navigation link takes me to /new-page']
