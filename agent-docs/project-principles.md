# Project Principles (LLM Journey)

These principles are specific to LLM Journey as an educational product.

## 1) Educational Clarity First
- Prefer explanations that a learner can follow.
- Do not introduce specialized terms without either:
  - a short explanation, or
  - a direct reference link.

## 2) Product End User Orientation
- Define who the page is for (Product End User) and what they should learn.
- Narrative and content should optimize learner progression, not only technical correctness.

## 3) Stage Continuity
- Preserve journey flow between stages.
- Continuity links and stage transitions are part of the product contract.

## 4) Honest Model Framing
- Clearly distinguish tiny demos, base models, and adapted/assistant behavior.
- Fallback/error states must be explicit in text, not color-only hints.

## 5) Premium-but-Readable UX
- Keep dual-theme quality high while prioritizing readability and instructional clarity.
- Visual polish should support learning, not distract from it.

## 6) Resource-Rich Learning
- Where possible, include references (papers, docs, notebooks, walkthroughs) for deeper exploration.
- Resource links should map to the concept introduced on the page.
