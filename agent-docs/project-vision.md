# Project Vision

## 🎯 Primary Goal
To build the world's best educational platform for understanding Large Language Models, from basic transformers to autonomous agents.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy
-  **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Every concept (RAG, Fine-tuning, Agents) must have a working, interactive implementation.
-  **Visual Excellence**: The UI must be premium, responsive, and "wow" the user. No ugly prototypes.
-  **Local First**: The project acts as a reference for privacy-preserving, local-first AI where possible.

## 🛡️ Non-Negotiables
-  **No Broken Builds**: The `main` branch must always deploy.
-  **No Magic Numbers**: All configuration must be explicit.
-  **No Silent Failures**: Errors must be visible to the user or logs.
-  **Aesthetics Matter**: If it works but looks bad, it's not done.

## ❌ What This Is NOT
- Not a production SaaS (no user accounts, billing, etc.)
- Not a research project (focus on education, not SOTA)
- Not a generic LLM wrapper (we build understanding, not just APIs)
