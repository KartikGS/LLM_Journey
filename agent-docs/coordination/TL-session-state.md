# Tech Lead Session State — CR-021

## CR ID
`CR-021 — Frontier and Adaptation Response Streaming`

## Session A Outcome
- Tech Lead direct change completed: `lib/config/generation.ts` `timeoutMs` updated to `30000` for both configs.
- Backend handoff issued: `agent-docs/conversations/tech-lead-to-backend.md`
- Plan artifact: `agent-docs/plans/CR-021-plan.md`
- Status: **Waiting for Backend Agent report at `agent-docs/conversations/backend-to-tech-lead.md`**

---

## Session B Entry Instructions

**Load these files only** (do not reload full Layer 1/2 context — the plan captures all decisions):
1. `agent-docs/plans/CR-021-plan.md` — primary context
2. `agent-docs/conversations/backend-to-tech-lead.md` — Backend completion report
3. Modified files from Backend Agent (list in report)
4. This file (`TL-session-state.md`)

---

## Session B Tasks (in order)

### Task 1: Backend Adversarial Review

Run the Backend report through the Verification Checklist in `tech-lead.md`:
- Read the Backend report (`backend-to-tech-lead.md`).
- Read each modified file line-by-line against the plan's SSE protocol specification.
- Confirm:
  - [ ] SSE event types match exactly: `start`, `token`, `done`, `error` — no extras, no renames
  - [ ] `start` event data shape correct for both routes (frontier metadata vs adaptation metadata)
  - [ ] Pre-stream fallback paths are unchanged (still return JSON)
  - [ ] `stream: true` added only to the HuggingFace provider branch in frontier route
  - [ ] Output cap (4000 chars) enforced server-side
  - [ ] `span.end()` called in `finally` after full stream — not before streaming starts
  - [ ] `FRONTIER_API_KEY` absent from all response payloads, log fields, span attributes
  - [ ] No debug artifacts (`console.log`, commented-out blocks, TODO markers)
  - [ ] New test cases cover: streaming live path, output cap, mid-stream error, non-SSE upstream response
  - [ ] Pre-stream fallback tests retained

### Task 2: Run Quality Gates

```
node -v
pnpm test
pnpm lint
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm build
```

Run in sequence. E2E is NOT required at this stage (Testing Agent handles it). Classify any failures as CR-related vs pre-existing.

### Task 3: Issue Frontend Handoff

After Backend review passes, issue the Frontend handoff at `agent-docs/conversations/tech-lead-to-frontend.md`.

**Pre-replacement check for `tech-lead-to-frontend.md`**: Read the existing file first. Confirm prior CR content is captured in its plan/report artifact before replacing.

**Frontend handoff scope** (defined in `agent-docs/plans/CR-021-plan.md` Step 2):

- **Files to modify:**
  - `app/foundations/transformers/components/FrontierBaseChat.tsx`
  - `app/models/adaptation/components/AdaptationChat.tsx`

- **Core change:** Replace `await response.json()` with an SSE stream reader in both components.

- **SSE client logic:**
  - If `response.headers.get('content-type')` contains `text/event-stream` → read as SSE stream
  - If `application/json` (or non-200 status) → parse as existing JSON fallback/error (unchanged path)
  - `start` event: update `mode` + `modelId` state; transition from loader to output area
  - `token` event: append `text` to `output` state; show progressive output + cursor
  - `done` event: remove cursor; finalize `statusText` based on `mode`
  - `error` event: set `status = 'error'`; set `statusText` from error message; remove cursor

- **State model change:**
  - Replace single `isLoading` boolean with two flags:
    - `isStreaming: boolean` — true from submit until `done`/`error`
    - `hasFirstToken: boolean` — true once first `token` event arrives
  - Loader shown while `isStreaming && !hasFirstToken`
  - Progressive output shown once `hasFirstToken`
  - Cursor shown while `isStreaming && hasFirstToken`
  - Cursor removed when `!isStreaming`

- **Input disabled for full streaming duration** (AC-9, AC-10): both `frontier-input`/`frontier-submit` and `adaptation-chat-input`/`adaptation-chat-submit` remain `disabled` while `isStreaming === true`.

- **All `data-testid` contracts preserved** per AC-12 (no renames, no removals).

- **Execution mode:** `feature-ui`

- **Adjust for any Backend deviations**: If Backend Agent's SSE protocol deviated from plan (e.g., different metadata shape), update the Frontend handoff accordingly before issuing.

### Task 4: Write Updated Session State for Session C

After issuing the Frontend handoff, update this file's "Session C Instructions" section with:
- Backend review outcome summary
- Quality gate results
- Any Backend deviations that affect Frontend implementation

Then enter Wait State (wait for Frontend Agent report at `agent-docs/conversations/frontend-to-tech-lead.md`).

## Session C Entry Instructions (filled by Session B Tech Lead)

### Session B Outcome Summary

**Backend adversarial review:** PASS (all 10 checklist items)
- SSE event types exact: `start`, `token`, `done`, `error` ✓
- `start` metadata shapes correct for both routes ✓
- Pre-stream fallback paths unchanged (still `NextResponse.json()`) ✓
- `stream: true` only in HuggingFace branch in frontier route ✓
- Output cap (4000 chars) enforced server-side in `streaming.ts` ✓
- `span.end()` only after full stream via `onDone`/`onMidStreamError` callbacks ✓
- `FRONTIER_API_KEY` absent from all SSE events, span attrs, log fields ✓
- No debug artifacts ✓
- All four new test scenarios covered in both test files ✓
- All pre-stream fallback tests retained ✓

**Quality gates (Node 20.20.0):** all PASS
- `pnpm lint` — PASS (deprecation notice pre-existing)
- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — PASS (exit 0)
- `pnpm test` — PASS (17 suites, 162 tests, 0 failures)
- `pnpm build` — PASS (OTel critical dependency warning pre-existing)

**Backend deviations affecting Frontend:** NONE
- `clearTimeout` restructure: internal only
- `onMidStreamError` enum code: internal only
- Dead code removal: no Frontend impact

**Frontend handoff issued:** `agent-docs/conversations/tech-lead-to-frontend.md`
**Status:** Waiting for Frontend Agent report at `agent-docs/conversations/frontend-to-tech-lead.md`

---

**Load these files only:**
1. `agent-docs/plans/CR-021-plan.md`
2. `agent-docs/conversations/frontend-to-tech-lead.md` — Frontend completion report
3. Modified frontend component files from Frontend Agent
4. This file (`TL-session-state.md`)

**Session C Tasks:**
1. Frontend adversarial review (state machine, cursor behavior, SSE reader correctness, all data-testid contracts preserved)
2. Run quality gates: `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm build`
3. Issue Testing handoff at `agent-docs/conversations/tech-lead-to-testing.md`
   - Testing Agent scope: evaluate `__tests__/e2e/transformer.spec.ts` for streaming timing impact; add adaptation E2E coverage if missing; run full E2E suite
   - Key concern: `frontierSubmit.toBeEnabled({ timeout: 15000 })` may need extension for stream duration; `Mode: (live|fallback)` status assertion timing needs to account for async `start` event
4. Update this file with Session D instructions
5. Enter Wait State

## Session D Entry Instructions (filled by Session C Tech Lead)

### Session C Outcome Summary

**Frontend adversarial review:** PASS (all checks)
- `isLoading` removed; `isStreaming` + `hasFirstToken` added in both components ✓
- Loader condition: `isStreaming && !hasFirstToken` ✓

- Cursor condition: `isStreaming && hasFirstToken` ✓
- SSE reader: `start` / `token` / `done` / `error` all handled correctly ✓
- `currentEvent` reset after each `data:` line ✓
- `reader.releaseLock()` in `finally` ✓
- All pre-stream JSON paths (non-200, non-SSE OK) unchanged ✓
- All `data-testid` contracts preserved ✓
- No debug artifacts ✓
- Minor process note: `FrontierBaseChat.test.tsx` was updated without declaring as deviation — change is correct and necessary; process violation only.
