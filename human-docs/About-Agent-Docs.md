# Idea

Agent docs aims to create documentation that agents can easily access to gather appropriate context depending on the task at hand. It attempts to have a modularized representation of the project so that non overlaping responsibilities can be assigned to different agents.

# Refinement

The docs are refined by conducting a feedback / meta analysis session after the agents have completed the workflow. 

# Issues

No concrete metric to measure whether agent docs are being approved or not.

# Future Plans
